### Hello! We are iGEM at Berkeley.

![iGEM at Berkeley Retreat](/images/about/retreat.jpg "iGEM at Berkeley")

We're UC Berkeley's only hands-on genetic engineering club for undergraduates.
Our mission is to provide undergraduates with the unique opportunity to perform original, student-led genetic engineering research projects. By building each student’s technical skillset, ability to work as a team, and passion in synthetic biology research, iGEM at Berkeley seeks to increase accessibility of the synthetic biology community to students of all backgrounds and research experience levels at Cal. Check out our **club structure** below to learn more about everything we do and how we do it.
