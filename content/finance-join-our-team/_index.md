### Our Purpose

Especially for research, managing finances is crucial! The Finance team at iGEM at Berkeley works to achieve two goals:
1. Manage current funds of our organization.
2. Obtain funds for our organization’s use.

We're responsible for all of the internal and external financial responsibilities in our organization. Our main projects this semester will be: 
1. Connecting with corporate sponsors with missions similar to iGEM at Berkeley and maintaining long-term partnerships. 
2. Obtaining Berkeley-specific funding through events such as Big Give, Crowdfunding, ESC Blue and Gold Funding, and more. 
3. Obtaining external funding from major scientific organizations such as the National Science Foundation (NSF), Society for Science, the Lawrence Foundation, and more. 
4. Managing our organization’s current finances and allocating funds to each experimental team. We will be working closely with experimental teams to gauge each teams’ financial needs and goals for their experiments.

### What You'll Gain

With our team, you’ll learn how to write grant proposals, network with biotechnology companies for funding opportunities, and learn to create a financial plan for the organization to ensure that our experimental teams get properly funded.
