### Abstract Formatting Guidelines

Make sure your abstract meetings the following requirements:

* Abstracts are limited to a maximum of 150 words. We strongly recommend abstracts are at least 100 words.

* Abstracts may be submitted individually, or on behalf of a group or team; if the latter is the case, please make sure to note so accordingly on the [**Present Registration Google Form**](https://forms.gle/GjATj185Y87WbKe1A) and have a main point of contact submit the abstract for your team. 

* A successful abstract will:
  1. Establish the motivation for the project or research undertaking (what is the problem? how has the problem been approached previously, and what are limitations to this approach?)
  2. Delineate an idea or approach that addresses this issue and previous hurdles other approaches have attempted.
    **You do not need to have, or mention, concluding results, data or figures; rather, a conceptual plan and some overview of (planned) testing and development is sufficient, and encouraged, to highlight at this time.
  3. Note certain applications of your study or research, and if applicable, future steps you will take to further your research that you would like to highlight.  
&nbsp;
* The abstract should be submitted as a **PDF, with 12-point Arial font and 1-inch margins (150 word limits)**.

* A sample abstract and formatting can be found [**here**](https://bit.ly/cubs-sample-abstract)

Submit your abstract [**here**](https://bit.ly/cubs-sp23) by **Sunday, April 2nd**
