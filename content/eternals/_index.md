### iGEM at Berkeley continually collaborates with industry and academia.

Our Eternals Team (formally Outreach) coordinates, plans, and hosts events, like [Breaking into Biosciences](/bib/), graduate student panels, and industry info sessions. The team also creates graphics and develops iGEM at Berkeley's brand, including this site! And we expand iGEM at Berkeley's network through sponsored recruitment sessions and further efforts with companies and other universities.

Eternals is divided into two subteams: External and Internal. Each team is responsible for different aspects of outreach, but work collectively as a group to bring all of iGEM's exciting events to you. 

> If you're interested in networking, marketing, or designing for Berkeley's only hands-on genetic engineering club for undergraduates, [join the External and Internal Teams](/apply).
