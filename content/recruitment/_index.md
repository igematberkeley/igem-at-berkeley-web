### Apply to our Experimental or Ideation Teams!

> We have several wetlab engineering and computational biology teams, each dedicated to addressing a distinct biological research question. Our experimental teams continue work on well-defined projects, while our ideation teams focus on exploring novel research areas. Joining iGEM at Berkeley helps build your technical skillset, ability to work as a team, and passion in bioengineering research. Regardless of your experience level, check out [our teams](https://igem.berkeley.edu/teams/) and consider [applying to an Experimental or New Ideas Team today](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc4kUSmc6TNFonkDwzAppapGv4q64xXsdXETc97yCoA8jOfSA/viewform?usp=sf_link) before applications close **January 28, 2023 at 11:59 p.m.**.

&nbsp;

### Apply to our lab DeCal!

> This spring, we're also offering a lab-based introduction to synthetic biology through a 2-unit DeCal called Foundations of Engineering Biology II (FERB II). If you enroll, you will be guided through a basic molecular cloning workflow. The prerequisites for FERB II are any of the following: FERB I (Fall), BIO 1A, AP Biology, or knowledge of (synthetic) biology fundamentals. There are 16 open spots and the preferred application deadline is **January 28 at 11:59 p.m.**. However, applications will be accepted until **February 1 at 11:59 p.m.** Read the full syllabus and apply to the DeCal on the [official DeCal website](https://decal.berkeley.edu/courses/6662).

> To learn more about the club, come to one of our infosessions on **January 23** or **January 25** from **8:00 - 9:00 p.m.** in **Dwinelle 109**.  Also, whether you're in iGEM or not, come to our DEI Night, an open discussion space centered around students from underrepresented backgrounds in STEM speaking about their unique experiences ([RSVP here](bit.ly/DEI-Sp23-01) and there will be free food!). If you have any questions, [register to join our Slack](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/4/d/e/1FAIpQLSciPYdSDdNb4FvcPPpFazVGbXGj0E5AF2ZrsiZi8MT6jDlGfQ/viewform?usp=send_form) and join the #ask-pls-anything channel! We look forward to meeting you!
