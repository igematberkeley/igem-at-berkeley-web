### Apply to our Experimental or New Ideas Teams!

> We have several wetlab engineering and computational biology teams, each dedicated to addressing a distinct biological research question. Our experimental teams continue work on well-defined projects, while our new ideas teams focus on exploring novel research areas. Joining iGEM at Berkeley helps build your technical skillset, ability to work as a team, and passion in bioengineering research. Regardless of your experience level, check out [our teams](https://igem.berkeley.edu/experimental/) and consider [applying to an Experimental or New Ideas Team today](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc4kUSmc6TNFonkDwzAppapGv4q64xXsdXETc97yCoA8jOfSA/viewform?usp=sf_link) before applications close **January 28, 2023**.

&nbsp;

### Sign Up for our DeCal!

> This spring, we're also offering a lab-based introduction to synthetic biology through a 2-unit DeCal called Foundations of Engineering Biology II (FERB II). If you enroll, you will be guided through a basic molecular cloning workflow. The prerequisites for FERB II are any of the following: FERB I (Fall), BIO 1A, AP Biology, or knowledge of (synthetic) biology fundamentals. There are 16 open spots, and sign-ups will be considered on a rolling basis. Enroll at [decal.berkeley.edu](https://decal.berkeley.edu/courses/).

> To learn more about the club, come to one of our infosessions (**January 19** or **January 23**), our DEI night, or [register to join our Slack](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/4/d/e/1FAIpQLSciPYdSDdNb4FvcPPpFazVGbXGj0E5AF2ZrsiZi8MT6jDlGfQ/viewform?usp=send_form) and join the #ask-pls-anything channel! We look forward to meeting you!
