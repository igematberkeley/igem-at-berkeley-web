### Apply to our Experimental or Ideation Teams!

> We have several wetlab engineering and computational biology teams, each dedicated to addressing a distinct biological research question. Our experimental teams continue work on well-defined projects, while our ideation teams focus on exploring novel research areas. Joining iGEM at Berkeley helps build your technical skillset, ability to work as a team, and passion in bioengineering research. Regardless of your experience level, [check out our teams](https://igem.berkeley.edu/teams/) and check back soon here or on our Instagram [@igematberkeley](https://instagram.com/igematberkeley) for our **Fall 2023 application**.

&nbsp;

### Apply to our DeCals: FERB I and FERB II

> This fall, we're offering both **Foundations of Engineering Biology (FERB) I**, a fundamental introduction to synthetic and computational biology, as well as **FERB II**, a lab-based introduction to synthetic biology that guides you through a basic molecular cloning workflow. 

> FERB I has no prerequisites. The prerequisites for FERB II are any of the following: FERB I (Fall), BIO 1A, AP Biology, or knowledge of (synthetic) biology fundamentals.

> Each DeCal has 16 open spots and the preferred application deadline is **September 2 at 11:59 p.m.**. However, applications will be accepted until **September 4 at 11:59 p.m**. [Learn more about our DeCals and read their full syllabi here](https://igem.berkeley.edu/ferb). Click [here](https://linktr.ee/igematberkeleydecals) or the button below to apply.
